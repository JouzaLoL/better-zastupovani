## Description

Better Zastupovani is an open-source attempt to enhance the current Zastupovani at [gytool](http://suplovani.gytool.cz)

The current software in use suffers from many flaws (and is horribly outdated), which Better Zastupovani tries to correct.

The data used in Better Zastupovani is pulled directly from the old system.
